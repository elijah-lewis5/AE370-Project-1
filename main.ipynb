    "## Methane-Oxygen Combustion\n",
    "\n",
    "Methane–oxygen combustion is a fundamental reaction that powers everything from household stoves to rocket engines. The process converts chemical energy into heat through a highly nonlinear set of coupled reactions between methane (CH₄) and oxygen (O₂), producing carbon dioxide and water. Because combustion involves fast, temperature-dependent reaction rates and competing forward and reverse reactions, it can be modeled as a dynamical system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the time evolution of species concentrations. This makes it ideal for AE 370 Project 1, where the objective is to analyze an engineering-relevant dynamical system using an appropriate numerical method. By simulating methane–oxygen kinetics, we can explore stability, stiffness, and convergence properties of time-integration schemes, providing both physical insight into combustion dynamics and a rigorous test case for evaluating numerical accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "Consider the reversible reaction: ${A + B \\leftrightharpoons C + D}$ with forward and reverse rate constants $k_f$ and $k_r$.\n",

    "Forward rate: $r_f = k_f [A][B]$\n",

    "### Physical Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "For methane–oxygen combustion, the overall reaction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CH}_4 + 2\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this process occurs through many intermediate reactions (CH₄ → CH₃ → CO → CO₂, etc.), but this captures the overall stoichiometry.\n",
    "To keep the system manageable, we model a simplified reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CH}_4 + \\text{O}_2 \\leftrightharpoons \\text{CO}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_f$ and $k_r$ represent the combined kinetics of oxidation and recombination.  \n",
    "This abstraction preserves the essential nonlinear coupling between reactant and product concentrations, making it an ideal reduced-order dynamical system for numerical experimentation.\n",
